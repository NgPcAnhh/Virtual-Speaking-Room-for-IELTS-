Hello everyone, I am currently releasing a product called VSR (Virtual Speaking Room), a Windows application that simulates the IELTS speaking test for those practicing speaking at home. The application is suitable for self-learners, those struggling to find speaking partners, or simply wanting to experience what an IELTS speaking test is like (in computer-based format). The question set is entirely taken from the speaking-forecast question bank, and each test randomly selects questions, ensuring practical relevance. However, because of this, the application is more suitable for those already familiar with the speaking test.
The application only requires a Windows computer with a microphone and speakers running smoothly for stable recording of the practice test. You can use this recording for various purposes; you can seek out experts or teachers who will provide you with the most accurate and precise feedback. Using the application will save you time in arranging and organizing speaking mock exams at centers or with teachers. Instead, you can proactively practice and take mock tests to increase your confidence and fluency in real test situations.
Additionally, we provide detailed instructions on how to convert the recording into a transcription. You can use this to ask AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude AI, etc.) to evaluate your speaking test. *However, note that the scores provided by AI are only for reference (and the pronunciation criterion cannot be taken into account).
