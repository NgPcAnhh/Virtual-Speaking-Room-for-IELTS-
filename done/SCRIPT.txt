This is the simulated speaking test and I'm your examiner. Can you hear my voice,   OK please make sure that your microphone is on and keep your surrounding area silent. You should adjust the volume before the test. Are you ready?     OK LET START

Now, in this first part, I’d like to ask you some questions about yourself. 

Now, I'm going to give you a topic and I’d like you to talk about it for one to two minutes. Before you talk, you’ll have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes if you wish. Here’s some paper and a pencil for making notes, and here’s your topic. 

All right? Remember, you have one to two minutes for this, so don’t worry if I stop you. I’ll tell you when the time is up.

Can you start speaking now, please?

OK the time is up. 

Thank you

let's move to part 3. I will ask you some questions related to the topic.Let’s consider

Thank you. That is the end of the speaking test.
